I developed a food recipe web application that allows users to search for recipes, view detailed information, and get a
list of ingredients and cooking instructions. The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and fetches data from TheMealDB
API. Key features include an intuitive search interface, dynamic content rendering, and a responsive design. I
implemented asynchronous data fetching and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. This project enhanced
my skills in working wuth third party apis, creatingresponsive design. Future improvements could include user
authentication and advanced search filters.
Technology Stack:
HTML: Used for structuring the web page and its elements.
CSS: Applied for styling the web page to make it visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: Implemented to handle user interactions and dynamically fetch and display recipe data.
TheMealDB API: Used for fetching recipe data based on user queries.
Key Features:
 Asynchronous Data Fetching: Utilized JavaScript's fetch API to make asynchronous requests to TheMealDB
API, ensuring a smooth user experience without page reloads.
 Dynamic Content Rendering: Used DOM manipulation to dynamically create and insert recipe elements based
on the fetched data.
 Responsive Design: Ensured the app is mobile-friendly by using CSS media queries and a flexible grid layout.
 Error Handling: Implemented basic error handling to inform users if there was an issue fetching recipes
